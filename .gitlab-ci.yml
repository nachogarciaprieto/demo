# This is an example configuration file for the gitlab CI pipeline

# This template shows how to run the different example tests that are provided
# when you first create the project. Use this template as an starting point
# for running your own tests on the gitlab CI pipeline
#
# IMPORTANT! The docker images used here are from the internal veepee artifactory
# (registry.vptech.eu) so you may need to add you credentials to the pipeline
# configuration to avoid an unauthorized error when using them.
#
# Check the README file to see all alternative ways of running your features.

# Happy testing!
